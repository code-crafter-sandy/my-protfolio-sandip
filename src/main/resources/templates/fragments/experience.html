                           As a Java developer working on an ERP web application, my main responsibility would be to develop and maintain the account model within the system. This involves designing, implementing, and optimizing the Java code that handles various aspects of accounting functionality, such as transactions, ledgers, and financial reporting. Additionally, you may collaborate with other developers and stakeholders to integrate the account model with other modules of the ERP system and ensure its seamless operation.
